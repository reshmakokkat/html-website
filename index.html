<h4>INTERNSHIP</h4>
<hr />
<b>KSEB 110 KV Substation, Pala</b><br />
<ul>
    <li>Gained practical knowledge about the transmission wing of the Power System and learned how electrical transmission works at various levels.</li>
<li>Learnt the procedures for handling electrical faults, implementing recovery processes, and ensuring safety measures while attending to them</li>
</ul>
<h4>PROJECTS</h4>
<hr />
<ul>
    <li><b>Bipolar Hybrid Circuit Breaker</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Engineered a Bipolar Hybrid DC Circuit Breaker using Arduino UNO, current sensors, and relay switches. Enhanced circuit reliability and optimized fault response time compared to previous models.</li>
            <li>Developed Arduino code to detect system faults and operate relay switches with sensors, gradually reducing the current to achieve artificial zero current crossing.</li>
        </ul>
    <li><b>Colour Sensor Prototype</b></li>
        <ul>
        <li>Designed and built a colour sensor prototype using an RGB diffuser LED and an LDR sensor to detect and identify colours based on variations in light intensity and wavelength.</li>
        <li>Developed and implemented Arduino code to process the output from the LDR sensor and pass it through a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network, enabling the system to accurately identify the colour based on sensor data.</li>
        <li>Demonstrated the detected colour on an LCD screen for visual feedback</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
