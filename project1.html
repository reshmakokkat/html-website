        <h2>Bipolar Hybrid DC Circuit Breaker</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Unlike AC, DC lacks a natural zero crossing. The proposed mechanism utilizes
            two switches along with two diodes to reverse the direction of the current flow
            and clear the fault. The DCCB is placed along with the source and load, and an
            AC circuit breaker is connected in series, as shown in figure. Here, there is
            no need for additional inductance, as the line inductance itself is used here. The
            proposed DCCB helps to create zero crossing, and the AC circuit breaker isolates
            the whole circuit during the fault. The included surge arrestor can be removed
            if the breaker is used close to the voltage source. A surge arrestor helps prevent
            damage to the circuit by diverting the excess voltage to the ground. The hybrid
            DCCB consists of two mechanical switches, and capacitors are connected parallel
            to each mechanical switch with redirecting diodes. Both switches are operated
            at different times, and they are controlled by a control signal.</p>

            <h3>Working</h3>
            <hr />
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Stage 1 :</b> In stage 1, both mechanical switches (SW1 and SW2) are closed,
                and the current flows through SW1, the power line, the load impedance,
                and SW2. At this stage, the capacitors have no charge, and the redirecting
                diodes are in the OFF state.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Stage 2 :</b> In stage 2, the trip signal is given to both SW1 and SW2, but
                        they will not open at the same time due to the difference in their mechanical
                        properties. Here, SW2 opens first and generates an increased voltage across
                        its contacts. As a result, the current is redirected through C2, and the
                        voltage across the breaker contacts increases rapidly, initiating an arc.
                        Because the series inductor, load impedance, and series resistance create aan
                        RLC circuit, the current will now be freewheeling through the circuit and
                        begin to decay beacause of the underdamped oscillation. The current will
                        flow through C2 until the voltage across C2 is less than the source voltage,and when it becomes greater than C2, diode D2 gets forward-biased. At
                        this stage, the capacitors have a charge, and the redirecting diodes are in
                        the OFF state.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Stage 3 :</b> In stage 3, C2 stops conducting current, D2 gets forward-biassed,
                and SW1 has been triggered, but due to delayed operation, it still conducts
                current. Here, because of the RL circuit, all the inductor energy will be
                dissipated in the resistor. Since it establishes the voltage stress across the
                breaker contacts and the rate of current decay, this stage is vital to the
                breaker’s operation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Stage 4 :</b> Here, SW1 opens and reroutes the current via C1 until the voltage
                across C1 is less than the voltage at the source. The current will now be
                running through an RLC circuit and it will start to decay, like in step 2.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Stage 5 :</b> D1 begins to conduct at this point because the voltage across
                        C2 is higher than the source voltage. Thus, the current flows through an
                        RL circuit, and any inductor energy remaining will be consumed by the
                        resistive component. Now that the current direction has changed, the RL
                        circuit will have a reverse DC voltage across it, which aids in achieving zerocrossover and rapid current decay.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Stage 6 :</b> The RLC circuit consisting of C1 and C2, line inductance, series
                resistance, and dc source causes voltages at C1 and C2 to decay to half the
                dc source once the current crosses zero and reverses direction, causing D1
                and D2 to turn off. In this state, there will be very little oscillating current
                since the capacitors have very little energy stored in them. By using a
                low-cost isolating series ac breaker and huge resistors connected in parallel
                with the capacitors, this capacitive energy can be depleted at the end of
                this stage.

                <h3>Operation</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    The circuit is assembled step by step, with components soldered onto a copper
board. Additional connections are made from the board to components that
cannot be soldered directly. Initially, both mechanical switches (relays) are closed
to test the circuit under normal conditions, excluding relay 3 from the circuit.
The relays, current sensors, and voltage sensor are connected to an Arduino UNO
for monitoring values via the serial monitor and to provide the VCC and ground
to the same.
A 12V battery provides power to the circuit, causing the bulb (load) to
illuminate, indicating current flow, measured at 2A by the current sensor.
TA multimeter registers a reading of 11.5V across the load, confirming proper
functionality of the relays and other circuit elements. During normal operation,
diodes and capacitors do not conduct any current.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An overload fault is given as the fault condition for testing the circuit. A 21W
bulb, connected in parallel to the existing load is used for giving the overload
case. Initially the 9w additional load is excluded from the circuit, resulting in
normal operation. When the connection is given, the additional load comes into
play, causing an overload in the circuit. When the current sensor measures a
current more than the normal current, relay2 opens as per the code given to
Arduino UNO. Then the current is redirected through the capacitor C2, causing
it to charge. When the charge across capacitor exceeds source voltage, diode
D1 is forward biased. Now the fault current flows through D1 forming an RL
circuit. After the capacitor voltage exceeds supply voltage, relay 1 is also opened
allowing the capacitor C1 to reroute the current, until the voltage across the C1
exceeds source voltage. Then the diode D2 is turned on. Now due to the reverse DC voltage across the RL circuit, the fault current decays fast and zero crossing
occurs. At this time, as per the code, when the current sensor near relay 3 shows
negative values causing relay3 to open. Here relay3 is used instead of the ac
breaker.

                    Initially the circuit is connected to the power supply with only a bulb load, relays
in the normally closed mode, the circuit maintained a stable current draw of
around 2A. Upon simulating an overload scenario by introducing an additional
bulb in parallel, an inrush current of approximately 7.3A was observed. The
circuit promptly detected this overload condition and successfully sent a tripping
signal to the relays, as indicated by the serial monitor messages and timestamped
interruptions. After tripping, the circuit effectively isolated itself from the power
supply, ensuring safety. The hardware testing has yielded promising results,
affirming its functionality and reliability in monitoring and responding to load
variations.

                <p>
                    The proposed hybrid bipolar DC circuit breaker generates a current zero-crossing
in the dc switch by reversing and re-routing the current and causes current decay
with minimal arc using two series relay switches, commutating capacitors, and
redirecting diodes. Hardware result show satisfactory performance in current
breaking, which keeps both current disruption time and transient over voltages
below that of the available mechanical or hybrid breakers and limited to the source
voltage. The capacitors along with diodes clamp the voltage, which occurs during
the fault, within the permissible limits. It is shown that rapid fault interruption
is achieved and no significant arc occurs between relay contacts. The flawless
operation of semiconductor devices, including current sensors, voltage sensors,
and relays, significantly contributes to the dependable functionality of the circuit.
These meticulously selected components ensure precise monitoring and control,
thereby enhancing the overall reliability and performance of the system. The
parallel capacitors and diodes within our system efficiently reroutes fault currents,
leveraging the inherent inductance to establish an RLC circuit. This strategic
arrangement significantly reduces fault currents, thereby mitigating potential
damage to the power distribution network.
